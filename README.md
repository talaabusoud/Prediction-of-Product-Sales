## Part 2: Data Exploration

We created several types of visualizations to better understand the data.

### Correlation Heatmap

`Item_MRP` (product price) has a strong positive relationship with sales â€” more expensive items tend to sell more.

### Sales by Outlet Type

`Supermarket Type3` has the highest median sales, showing outlet type influences how well products sell.
